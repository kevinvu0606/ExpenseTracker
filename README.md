## 🛠️ Technologies used
- HTML/CSS
- Node JS/Express
- MongoDB
- React
- Material UI library 

## 📐 Planning
- The original iteration was to build the Full stack application which only showed total balance
- this was iterated to show transaction history then, income vs expenses
- Finally graphs were implmeneted 
- this would all need to be hooked into a mongodb database

## 🐛 Bugs
- if there are multiple .99 transctions, rounding errors can occur

## 🌱  Future updates
- Add a user login 
- Add a navigation bar/side bar that will display specific components
- Add an "other" category that will allow user input

## 🚧 My experience
### Key learning:
